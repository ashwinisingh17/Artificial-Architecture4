Artificial Architecture Website

Welcome to the Artificial Architecture project repository! This repository hosts the source code for a powerful website designed to revolutionize the process of architectural design. Our platform leverages cutting-edge technology to generate bespoke house blueprints based on user specifications.

Features

Home: The homepage serves as an introduction to our innovative platform, showcasing its 
    capabilities and benefits.
About: In this section,users can gain insight into the vision behind the Artificial Architecture  project, learning about its objectives and the talented individuals driving its success.

Contact: We value user feedback and inquiries. The Contact section provides various means to reach out to our team, ensuring a seamless communication experience.

Generate: The heart of our platform lies in the Generate section. Here, users can input crucial parameters such as the dimensions of their land and the desired number of bedrooms. Using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, our system generates both 2D and 3D blueprints tailored to the user's preferences.


How to Use
Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine using the following command: git clone https://github.com/your-username/artificial-architecture.git.
Navigate to the project directory.
Launch the index.html file in your preferred web browser.
Explore the intuitive navigation bar to access different sections of the website.
Head to the "Generate" section to input your land dimensions and bedroom requirements, and watch as our platform conjures up stunning architectural blueprints tailored to your needs.
Predefined Dataset
Our platform draws upon a meticulously curated dataset of house designs to fuel its blueprint generation process. These designs are data blueprint images are coming from the hardcoded dataset in the backend, ensuring that users have access to a wide range of options.

Technologies Used
To bring our vision to life, we harness a blend of cutting-edge technologies, including:

Tailwind CSS and HTML: A utility-first CSS framework that streamlines the styling process, allowing for rapid development and easy maintenance of our website's interface.
Python: Our backend infrastructure is powered by Python, enabling seamless integration with machine learning algorithms for blueprint generation.
Machine Learning: Leveraging the power of machine learning, our platform employs sophisticated algorithms to analyze user inputs and generate personalized architectural blueprints.
